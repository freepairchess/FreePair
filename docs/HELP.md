# FreePair user guide

**Applies to FreePair v0.70.20260814**

FreePair is a chess tournament pairing program for tournament directors.
It imports SwissSys event files, pairs Swiss and round-robin sections,
tracks results and standings, prints the paperwork, and produces the
USCF rating report at the end.

This guide describes what you see on screen and the order you are likely
to do things in. If you are looking for *why* the pairing engine made a
particular decision, that is a different document: open the **Why this
pairing?** dialog on any board and follow the rule citation, or read the
USCF rules reference that ships alongside this guide.

---

## Getting started

### What FreePair does

FreePair runs an event end to end:

- Open or create an event, with one or more **sections**.
- Build each section's **roster**, verifying USCF/FIDE IDs and ratings.
- **Pair** each round, review the pairings before committing them, and
  intervene where the rules allow.
- Record **results**, and watch standings, tiebreaks and the wall chart
  update as you go.
- **Print** pairing sheets, standings, wall charts and prize lists.
- **Publish** pairings and results online, and file the rating report.

Two pairing engines are available. The **USCF (FreePair) engine** handles
USCF-rated Swiss events and is the default. The **FIDE (BBP) engine**
implements the FIDE Dutch system for FIDE-rated events. Round-robin
sections use FreePair's own scheduler and neither engine.

### Installing and updating

The installer bundles everything FreePair needs, including the .NET
runtime and both pairing engines. There is nothing to install
separately.

FreePair can check for new versions on startup. Turn this on or off
under **Settings → Auto-update → Check for updates on startup**, or use
**Check now** at any time. If you want early builds, tick **Include
pre-release builds (beta channel)** — otherwise you only see stable
releases.

Your current version is shown in Settings, and in the main window title
bar.

### The main window

The window has two tabs:

- **Tournament** — everything to do with the event you have open.
- **Settings** — application-wide preferences that apply to every event.

The **Theme** picker sits at the top right and applies immediately. The
**Help** button beside it opens this guide.

If an event is open, the title bar shows the event name and the file it
is saved to.

---

## Creating and opening events

### Creating a new event

Use **➕ Create New Event**. You will be asked for the event name, dates
and location, and then for at least one section. An event with no
sections cannot be paired, so it is normal to create the first section
immediately.

### Opening an existing event

**🔁 Re-Open Saved Event** offers the events you have worked on recently.
You can also browse the file system for a SwissSys `.sjson` file, or
browse events published to NA Chess Hub.

FreePair reads SwissSys files and writes them back in the same format,
preserving anything it does not itself manage. An event created in
SwissSys can be opened in FreePair and vice versa.

### Event details

The event's **Overview** covers the name, dates, location, time control
and the defaults new sections inherit. Time control and location appear
on printed reports, so they are worth filling in even though pairing does
not use them.

### Sections

Each section is paired independently and has its own roster, rounds,
standings and prizes.

- **➕ Add section** creates one. You choose the number of rounds, the
  pairing kind (Swiss or round robin) and which rating is used.
- **🗑 Delete section…** removes one, with a confirmation that tells you
  how many rounds and results you are about to lose.
- **Copy section** duplicates a section's setup, which is useful when an
  event has several similarly configured sections.
- **⧉ Open in Window** pops a section out into its own window, so you can
  watch two sections side by side.

Sections are laid out so that no two share a physical board number.
FreePair recommends starting board numbers automatically; you can
override them on the section's Overview tab or with **Renumber section
starting boards**.

---

## Players

### Adding players to a roster

The **Roster** tab holds the players in a section. You can add players
one at a time, look them up in the online player database, or pull a
whole roster from NA Chess Hub.

Adding a player after the event has started is supported. FreePair works
out what the late entrant should be scored for the rounds already played
and shows you the result before you commit.

### Verifying IDs and ratings

**ID and Rating** verifies USCF and FIDE IDs against the online player
database and fills in the current ratings.

**Roster Update** re-pulls live ratings for the whole section. Two
warnings exist here on purpose:

- Once a round has been paired, refreshing ratings can change the
  pairing basis mid-event, so FreePair asks first.
- Around the start of a month, a rating supplement may be about to
  change; FreePair points this out so you can decide which supplement
  the event should use.

Both need an internet connection.

### Optional columns

**⚙ Optional Columns** chooses which columns the roster shows. By default
columns with no data are hidden so the grid stays readable; turn on the
"show empty columns" option when you are about to fill them in. The
choice is saved with the section.

**Title** is shown by default. On a FIDE-rated section it decides the
order of players on equal ratings, so it is worth seeing next to the
pair numbers rather than having to go looking for it. Untitled players
leave the cell blank. Turn it off in the chooser if you do not want it.

### The roster sorts itself before round 1

Until the first round is paired, the roster keeps itself in seeding
order. Add a player and they drop into their proper place rather than
onto the end; correct someone's rating, or give them a title, and they
move accordingly. Equal ratings are broken by the section's own rules —
including the title step on FIDE sections — so what you see is the
order the event will actually pair on.

Refreshing ratings re-sorts the roster the same way.

**Once a round is paired this stops**, and pair numbers are fixed for
the rest of the event. They have to be: the rounds already played refer
to players by those numbers, so renumbering would change who is
recorded as having played whom. Editing a player after that point still
works — the number just stays put.

### Check-in

Some events pair only players who have physically arrived. Turn on
**Players must check in before pairing** for a section, then use
**Check-In Player** and **Undo Check-In**. Players who have not checked
in are left out of the pairing pool.

### Teams

For team events, **Team section** enables team handling, and
**Team Setup** and **Team Lineup** define the teams and board order.
FreePair can avoid pairing teammates against each other; where the rules
require it, that preference is relaxed rather than broken.

### Moving players between sections

**⇄ Move players…** transfers players between sections, carrying their
history with them. This is the correct way to handle a player who was
entered in the wrong section.

---

## Pairing rounds

### Before you pair

Check that the roster is complete, IDs are verified, byes are requested
and — if you use it — check-in is done. Pairing is reversible, but it is
much less disruptive to get the pool right first.

### Pairing a round

**Pairing Operations** pairs the next round for the section. To pair
every section at once, use the pair-all-sections action from the event
page.

For the first round you may be asked who plays White on board 1, and how
the field should be seeded. Later rounds are determined by the pairing
rules and need no input.

The seeding prompt offers **Re-sort** — marked *(Recommended)* and
pre-selected, so pressing Enter takes it — or **Keep current order**.
Take the re-sort. The pairing rules assume the engine's own seeding
order, and the button names which one applies: *Re-sort (FIDE order)* or
*Re-sort (USCF order)*. Let FreePair number the field from the rules
rather than adjusting pair numbers by hand; a hand-edited order can
produce boards the rules would not have chosen, and it is the order the
engine is given. **Keep current order** exists for the narrow case where
the numbers were assigned elsewhere and must be reproduced exactly —
matching an arbiter-assigned starting list on an imported event, for
instance.

If you accept the re-seed, players are numbered strongest first — and
what breaks a tie between players on the **same** rating depends on the
section's engine:

- **USCF sections** fall straight to alphabetical order by name
  (USCF 28E).
- **FIDE sections** put **title** in between: GM, IM, WGM, FM, WIM, CM,
  WFM, WCM, then untitled, and only then alphabetical
  (FIDE C.04.2 2.2). The women's titles genuinely do interleave with the
  open ones — a WGM seeds above an FM — which looks odd but is what the
  rule says.

Only FIDE titles count for that ordering. A national title such as **NM**
is kept and shown on the roster, but seeds as untitled, because the FIDE
rule does not rank it and inventing a position for it would change who
plays whom.

This matters more than it sounds: in round 1 everyone is on zero and
nobody is owed a colour, so the seeding order is the **only** thing
deciding the boards.

### Pairing as quads

**Pair as quads** divides a section into four-player round-robin groups,
seeded by rating: the top four, the next four, and so on. Each quad is
paired immediately — all three rounds at once, since in a four-player
all-play-all every game is known from the start. Any remainder becomes a
Swiss group you pair normally.

**A section of exactly four players is simply converted into a quad.**
It keeps its name, no new sections appear, and nothing is deleted — the
section already *is* the quad, so there is nothing to divide. Larger
sections do get split, and the original is kept but soft-deleted so its
players do not count twice; you can undo that by restoring it and
removing the generated sections.

Either way the players are re-seeded by rating first, because the
round-robin schedule is built around the top seed.

### Reviewing before you commit

Pairings are shown for review before they become final. In this preview
you can:

- See every board with colours and ratings.
- Swap colours on a board.
- Convert a pairing to a half-point bye.
- Force a specific pairing, or forbid one.

Each player's title is shown in front of their name — "GM Smith" — on
screen and on the printed pairing sheet. It is part of the player cell
rather than a column of its own, so it costs no extra width. The
pairing-columns chooser can turn it off per side.

Nothing is written to the event until you accept.

### Why this pairing?

Every board has a **?** button. It opens the **Why this pairing?**
dialog, which explains the board in plain language:

- The **pairing reason** — why these two players were put together.
- The **colour assignment** — why each player got the colour they did.
- The **round context** — floats, byes and anything else that shaped the
  round.

Each line ends with the rule that drove the decision, as a clickable
citation that opens the rules reference at that exact rule. This is the
fastest way to answer a player who is questioning their pairing.

**Which rule book you see depends on how the section is paired.** USCF
sections cite the USCF *Official Rules of Chess* and open the USCF
reference; FIDE sections cite the FIDE Handbook's Dutch system (C.04.3)
and open the FIDE reference. The citation says which — `(USCF 29E5 — …)`
or `(FIDE 5.2.1 — …)` — so there is no doubt which book you are quoting.
Both are installed with FreePair and work with no internet.

For a FIDE section the dialog explains:

- which score group each player was in, and whether the pair crossed
  groups — and if so, who floated up and who floated down;
- what colour each player was due and how strongly (absolute, strong or
  mild), and whether they got it;
- who received the pairing-allocated bye, and who was not allowed one
  because they had already had it;
- whether a player is floating in the same direction they floated in a
  recent round.

**One honest limitation for FIDE sections.** FreePair pairs them with the
bbpPairings engine, which reports each player's situation and the pairing
it chose, but not its internal search. So the dialog can tell you why a
player was in a particular group, why they got a particular colour, and
why they floated — but it cannot tell you why they were paired against
*that particular opponent* rather than another player on the same score.
Nothing FreePair could say about that would be more than a guess, so it
does not say it.

It is also worth knowing that some FIDE rules are *preferences*, not
hard limits. The rules ask the engine to keep unmet colour preferences
and repeated floats to a minimum, not to eliminate them. So a line
saying a preference was not granted, or that a player downfloated twice
running, is reporting a deliberate decision where something of higher
priority took precedence — not a mistake.

### The pairing bracket diagram

Below the explanation, a FIDE board shows the **pairing bracket** it was
paired in — the group of players the engine was working with at that
point, and the pairs it made from them.

- Players are listed **in the engine's seeding order** — strongest first.
  That is how the Dutch system assigns pairing numbers before round 1, and
  it is what the engine pairs from. It usually matches the order of the
  pair numbers you see on the roster, but not always: a player added
  mid-event takes the next free pair number rather than the one their
  rating would earn, so they appear in the bracket at their playing
  strength, not at the end.
- **S1** and **S2** are the two subgroups the Dutch system splits a
  bracket into.
- Players shown in **brown moved down** from a higher score group,
  with the score they brought with them. This is what explains a board
  where the two players are not on the same score.
- The badge after each rating is the colour that player was due:
  `W`/`B` absolute, `(W)`/`(B)` strong, `w`/`b` mild, `A` none yet.
- Any player who took the bye out of this bracket is named underneath.

**Every line is drawn the same way, and that is deliberate.** The engine
does not report how it chose between the possible opponents inside a
bracket, so the diagram shows you which pairs were made — not which were
"expected" and which were not. Any such marking would be a guess dressed
up as a fact.

USCF sections show a different diagram, the score-group switch diagram,
which reflects how the USCF engine pairs. The two are not
interchangeable.

### Adjusting pairings

After a round is paired you can still swap colours, force or forbid
pairings, and re-pair. Forced pairings and do-not-pair instructions apply
to the current session.

### Unpairing a round

A round can be deleted if you paired it too early or the roster was
wrong. FreePair tells you how many recorded results you are about to
lose, and takes a checkpoint first so the round can be recovered.

Deleting pairings for the whole event at once is possible, and is
deliberately harder to do by accident: the confirmation is red, and
**Cancel** is the default button, so pressing Enter backs out.

### Round-robin sections

Round-robin sections are scheduled rather than paired: every player meets
every other player, and the whole schedule is produced at once. The
pairing engines are not involved.

---

## Byes and withdrawals

The **Byes & Withdrawals** tab is where absences are managed.

- **Half-point byes** are requested in advance by the player. Record them
  and the player is withheld from that round's pairing pool.
- **Full-point byes** are assigned by FreePair when a section has an odd
  number of players. The rules decide who receives one; a player who has
  already had a full-point bye will not normally get another.
- **Zero-point byes** cover a player who is absent without a request.
- **Withdrawing** a player removes them from future rounds while keeping
  the games they have already played.

Byes are shown on the Roster, on the Pairings tab with a count, and on
the Standings, so a bye is hard to miss.

You can also assign a bye mid-event once a round is already paired.

---

## Results and standings

### Entering results

Results are entered on the **Pairings** tab, board by board. Standings,
tiebreaks and the wall chart update immediately.

### Standings and tiebreaks

The **Standings** tab ranks players by score and then by tiebreak.
**🏆 Tiebreaks…** chooses which tiebreak systems apply and in what order.
Tiebreak columns are sortable, and sort by the underlying value rather
than the displayed text.

Half-point and zero-point byes appear in their own columns, so you can
check them against your written list at a glance.

A **Title** column sits beside the rating, matching the roster.

### Wall chart

The **Wall Chart** tab shows the traditional cross-table: every player's
round-by-round result, opponent and colour. It carries the same
**Title** column as the standings.

On the printed versions of both sheets the title column appears only
when somebody in the section actually has a title — these tables are
already wide, and a column of blanks would squeeze the round codes for
nothing.

### Crosstable

Round robin, double round robin and quad sections get a **📄 Print
crosstable** button, on both the **Pairings** and **Wall Chart** tabs.
It produces the traditional all-play-all grid: one row and one column
per player, where the cell where a row meets a column is what that
row's player scored against that column's player — **1**, **½** or
**0** — followed by score and tiebreaks.

- **Rows and columns are both in pairing-number order**, and the
  opponent columns are headed by those same numbers, so the grid is
  read number against number.
- **The diagonal is shaded**, because a player cannot meet themselves.
  That is different from a blank cell, which means the game has not
  been played yet.
- **A double round robin shows both games in one cell**, in round
  order — so `1 ½` means a win in the first meeting and a draw in the
  second.
- **Title, name and rating share one column** — "GM He, Anthony 2500" —
  as on the pairing sheet. Whether the title and rating appear follows
  your pairing-column settings, so the two reports describe a player the
  same way. The score, colour and due-colour options are ignored here:
  colours vary by opponent on a crosstable, and the total already has
  its own column.

The button does not appear on Swiss sections. In a Swiss the players
never all meet, so a crosstable would be mostly empty; the wall chart
is the report for that format.

**The crosstable also shows in a window.** Open the Pairings or Wall
Chart tab in a window (**⧉ Open in Window**) and the crosstable appears
above the grid, with a **Show crosstable** tick box to hide it. It is on
by default for round robin and quad sections, because for those formats
it is usually the view you want — the round below is one slice of it.

### Prizes

The **Prizes** tab handles the prize fund. **✏ Edit prizes…** defines the
prizes, **🧮 Calculate prizes** distributes them according to the
standings, and **🗑 Clear prizes** starts over.

---

## Printing and reports

**📄 Print** produces a PDF of whatever you are looking at — pairings,
standings, wall chart, roster or prizes. Reports are landscape by default
because tournament tables are wide, and each carries the event name,
section, time control, location, dates, a page number and a timestamp.

**Print Setup** controls page options, and the grid and print fonts can
be adjusted independently, which is useful when a wall chart is one
column too wide for the page.

Under **Settings → Printing**, **Use ASCII-only output** replaces the ½
glyph with plain text for printers and downstream systems that cannot
render it.

---

## Saving your work

### FreePair saves as you go

There is no "unsaved changes" state to worry about. Every change is
written to your event file as you make it, and the **Save event** dialog
exists mainly to tell you where that file is.

That dialog also offers:

- **Rename (Save As)…** — give the event a new file name or folder. From
  then on every change goes to the new file; the old one is left exactly
  as it is.
- **Save a copy…** — write a frozen snapshot elsewhere while you keep
  working in the current file.
- **Earlier versions…** — open a checkpoint.

### Earlier versions and undo

Before each significant change — pairing or deleting a round, importing
players, deleting a section — FreePair quietly saves a checkpoint. You
can open one to compare against your current event, or go back to it.

**↶ Undo** and **↷ Redo** cover ordinary editing within a session.

---

## NA Chess Hub

### Roster sync

If your event is registered on NA Chess Hub, FreePair can pull the entry
list and keep it in step as players enter, withdraw or change section.

FreePair checks periodically and shows a red count beside any section
with changes waiting, and beside the Sections header for the event total.
Clicking a section's badge opens the review for that section; clicking
the header total opens the whole event. You review every change before
anything is applied.

Only changes you can act on are counted. A walk-up entrant who is not on
NA Chess Hub is a permanent difference, not a pending change, so it does
not sit there pinning the badge on forever. If a check fails, the last
known counts stay on screen rather than resetting to zero — "no changes"
and "could not check" are not the same thing.

Turn the alerts on or off, and set how often they run, under
**Settings → Alert when NA Chess Hub roster has updates to sync**.

### Publishing pairings and results

Publishing puts pairings and results on the event's public page so
players can follow along. You can set new events to publish
automatically under **Settings → Online publishing**.

### Cloud backup

**Save a copy (backup) to NA Chess Hub** stores a copy of the event file
in the cloud so you can open it from another computer. It is a backup,
not a publish — it does not make pairings visible to spectators.

It is a snapshot: if you keep working after saving one, the cloud copy is
out of date until you save another.

Optionally the copy can carry your display settings — theme, fonts, score
style, column choices, filters and pop-out window positions — so the
event looks and prints the same on another machine.

---

## Filing the USCF rating report

When the event is over, the USCF export produces the rating report.
FreePair fills in what it knows from the event and asks you for the
affiliate and TD details it cannot infer.

---

## Settings

Settings apply to the application, not to one event.

- **Display** — theme, and the size of app text and grid text.
- **Tournament files** — where events are saved, and whether you are
  prompted for a folder each time.
- **Pairing** — pairing-engine behaviour, and re-showing the
  pairing-engine notice.
- **Pairing Engines** — the USCF and FIDE engine binaries. These are
  bundled with the installer and normally need no attention.
- **Online player database** — the service used to verify IDs and
  ratings.
- **Online publishing** and **NA Chess Hub URL** — publishing defaults
  and the service address.
- **Printing** — ASCII-only output.
- **Auto-update** — update checks and the release channel.

---

## Troubleshooting

**A dialog is too tall for my screen.** Dialogs scroll and can be
resized. The action buttons stay visible at the bottom.

**A rule citation opens the rules document at the top instead of the
rule.** The rules reference ships with the app and is opened in your
default browser. If it has been removed from the installation, FreePair
falls back to the online copy, which needs a connection.

**Ratings did not update.** Rating refresh needs an internet connection
and verified IDs.

**A player was paired against someone they already played.** Open **Why
this pairing?** on that board — the explanation names the rule and the
constraint that forced it. Genuine avoidable rematches are a bug worth
reporting.

**I paired the wrong round.** Delete the round. A checkpoint is taken
first.
